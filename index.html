              <h2 class="page-header first">Overview</h2>

              <p>In this document you're going to find a ton of reading, videos, and quizzes that Flatiron students complete before their semester even begins. We thought we'd open source this material.</p>

              <p>The main topics we want students to know about before the semester starts are on the left: Internet Basics, Command-Line Interface, Git Version Control, SQL and Databases, HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.</p>

              <p>Each resource has an estimated amount of time it should take you if you have zero prior knowledge on the topic. If you are coming to this with absolutely no experience then we estimate this work will take you between 80 - 100 hours to complete. If you are a rockstar then it shouldn't take more than 20 hours.</p>

              <p>We make suggestions of how much time to spend on each section. Try and achieve the learning objectives in the suggested time frame, then move on. You can always come back and watch the section again.</p>

              <p>If you are familiar with the topic, we highly suggest trying to take the quiz or challenge first. If you pass easily and collect the badge, great, move on. That being said, even we found ourselves learning new things during this assessment. So maybe try to watch the videos on the topics with which you are most unfamiliar.</p>

              <p>In terms of reading and watching videos, feel free to skip through - go for overall coverage as opposed to depth. Try to read and watch as much as possible and then try to take the quiz. Be quick, and then do a 2nd round of reading and watching.</p>

              <p>We strongly believe that learning should have context, and you should know what your goals are.  Each section will list which learning objectives it will cover, and at the beginning we expect all of you to check out the Ruby assesment so you know what you'll be expected to do at the end.  There's an infinite amount of things you could spend your time learning. Part of the value of the prework is that we can narrow the scope to only the most essential.  If you can achieve some level of comfort in the following topics we believe you'll flourish at the Flatiron School.</p>

              <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
              <p>
                To complete these units, you will need a <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/enrollments/dnFtaXFMbXROSVVqT3N1bngwWnBRUjhGc2k1Z1dEOW52cFJvZEMzRUZvRT0tLWpvUElMODBvdFhiZlA4MjE2Mlc2c1E9PQ==">CodeSchool</a> account. They are each normally $25 a month, so figure you might spend $50-$100 depending on how quickly you get through the material. So far the fine folks at <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/enrollments/dnFtaXFMbXROSVVqT3N1bngwWnBRUjhGc2k1Z1dEOW52cFJvZEMzRUZvRT0tLWpvUElMODBvdFhiZlA4MjE2Mlc2c1E9PQ==">CodeSchool</a> have created a $9 trial month for all Flatiron Preworkers. Register using that link. Treehouse will offer something similar soon. You also will need a <a href="http://codeacademy.com">CodeAcademy</a> account which is free.
              </p>
              <p>You should also have a Rails Development environment setup. There are lots of guides for that on the internet and depending on your OS and setup, it's a bit of a process. You could always use the cross-platform <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">Rails Installer</a>.</p>

              <p><em>Note to students accepted into the Flatiron School</em>. We will provide you with an account to treehouse and codeschool, feel free to use your own to get started, but we cover those costs for the duration of the prework and semester.</p>

              <h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
              <p>
                One of the challenges in learning how to code is that you probably don't even know what you're supposed to learn. When creating this prework, we had 4 goals in mind.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Full Stack</strong><br />
                  We'll present the full stack of technologies required to build a webapp from the ground up. We don't care if you use ERB or HAML. The web is built on HTML and everyone should learn it. Whether NoSQL or RDBMS, understanding the fundamentals of schema design and SQL is crucial. Students shouldn't shy away from depth. How can you be a web developer without a proficiency in these skills?
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Linear Progression</strong><br/ >
                  The material is presented in order, going from web basics and computer basics, to markup, to styling, to version control, to programming, and then to databases and web frameworks.  You learn the basics of code through Ruby and then finally move to Rails that builds upon the rest. Thus you start at the lowest level, the literal HTML the browser renders, and progress up through levels of abstraction until you finally get to the kitchen sink that is the Rails framework. As a beginner, don't try to learn Rails without knowing basic HTML/CSS and ruby. It's a disservice to your education.
                </li>


                <li>
                  <strong>Curated Resources</strong><br/>
                  There is such a plethora of amazing content on learning to code. We liked the consistency of going to a few sources that all shared common interfaces and learning patterns, like videos and interactive portions. So this isn't a complete list of all the resources, but more a curated list of what we think works well together (with lots of feedback from alumni). We would love it if you submitted a github issue with more materials you've enjoyed.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Language Agnosticism</strong><br/>
                  In the end, programming is about abstractions and expressions. The mechanics of code are universal and exist in all modern languages, like python, ruby, and javascript. We teach Ruby because we love it. Thinking your language choice, especially as a beginner, matters, is like thinking that you can only write poetry in English and not in Spanish. Obviously the beauty of poetry is in rhyme and meter, in metaphor and simile, in cadence and rhythm, not in the king's English. Why should code be any different? At Flatiron, you're learning how to think, how to break problems down, how to express yourself, how to abstract ideas, and how to work together. We just learn that through Ruby.
                </li>

              </ol>
              
              <h2 id="thoughts">Learning Objectives</h2>

              The goal of this tutorial is to be able to do the following:

                    <ol>
                      <li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment</li>
                      <li>Understand where programming skills fit into the "web"</li>
                      <li>Understand what pieces make up a web application</li>
                      <li>Develop a level of comfort with the most common ruby patterns in web development</li>
                      <li>Understand the basics of version control and why it is used</li>
                      <li>Have a basic understanding of HTML including forms</li>
                      <li>
                        Through Rails you should learn the following:
                        <ul>
                          <li>RESTful interfaces</li>
                          <li>HTTP</li>
                          <li>Routing</li>
                          <li>Where ruby fits in the web development stack</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Develop a comfort with basic SQL queries</li>
                      <li>Have a basic understanding of an ORM, ActiveRecord</li>
                      <li>Develop a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS</li>
                    </ol>

              <h2>Why Share It?</h2>
              <p>
                You might be wondering why we would share our curriculum if we are in the education business. First, we honestly do not think that going through this content alone will make anyone a web developer. That's like saying that knowing how to hammer a nail means you can build a house. Sure, you've got the gestures and mechanics down, maybe, but you don't know the first thing about building. There is just so much more to being a developer than the syntax of how to define a method or iterate over an array. We don't focus on content at the Flatiron School. We focus on learning to love code.</p>

              <p>The command line is your home base.  It's probably one of the most important differences between a consumer of a computer, and a user.  Many developers have all sorts of crazy short cut keys set up so that they can use their computer solely from the command line without ever having to reach for the mouse.  It's vitaly important that you start thinking like a developer, rather than a consumer.  Getting comfortable with the command line is the first step.  If you feel like you're spending too much time on this section, and you've accomplished the learning objectives, move on.<br/>

                What is version control?! <br/><br/>

                from Github's "About Version Control" Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Even though the examples in this book show software source code as the files under version control, in reality any type of file on a computer can be placed under version control.

                <p>My conscience won’t let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply that the language works primarily on the computer’s terms. That the language is designed to accomodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore, we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s locale. It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.</p>
                <p>But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms to express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!</p>
                <p>We can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is coderspeak. It is the language of our thoughts.</p>

              <p>Programming allows you to automate common, repetitive tasks on the computer. Developers use programming languages to write software, the software you interact with every day. From you alarm clock to your computer; from the web to the satellites orbiting our planet, software powers all of it.</p>

              <p>Ruby is a programming language that we can use to do any task that needs to be automated.  For example, something that is really irritating is a cluttered "Downloads" folder on your Mac. We could write a program that moves a file to a new folder, based on it's file extension, whenever we download something. A "scripting-language" would be best suited for this task.</p>

              <p>Ruby is one of the most popular languages to create web applications.  A web framework is a tool that makes developing for the web relatively simple. The most popular web frameworks for Ruby are Sinatra and Ruby on Rails.  All of these languages and web frameworks are considered server side languages as they will be run on an actual web server.</p>

              <p>In a previous section you built a static website using HTML and CSS. You used markup languages to tell the browser how to render the content you were displaying. In order to have the ability to interact with your users and store the information they give you, we'll need to add more technologies to our toolbelt. These technologies are usually referred to as your "Stack."</p>

              <p>
                A stack usually includes the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Operating System: a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs e.g. <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a></li>
                  <li>Web Server: Software that helps deliver web content to a client e.g. <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a></li>
                  <li>Database: An organized collection of data. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> for example.</li>
                  <li>Programming Language, like <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a></li>
                  <li>A Web Framework like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                We've already covered the basics of your operating system and done a brief intro to Ruby. Now we will do a short intro to the language that is used by most of the databases we will be using, SQL.
              </p>

              <h2 id="sql-databases">SQL and Databases <em>4hr Max 10hr</em></h2>

              <p>
                In order for a web application to be useful it needs to store data, access that data and organize the data. This is the job of a database. Typically web apps respond to user input and do one of four things, create, read, update, or delete data in a database. Ruby serves as a kind of intermediary between the user and the database and Ruby can communicate with a database in its native language, which for our purposes is SQL.

              <p>The Treehouse SQL course is comprehensive and easy to follow. It uses MySQL, which is a powerful database server that we don't really use at Flatiron for teaching purposes, but learning how to install it and use its GUI isn't a waste of time. So feel free to gloss over the MySQL setup / specific stuff, but it's useful.</p>

              <p>A more technical introduction to SQL through SQLite3 and the Terminal. It's short and intense, but try to get through the entire thing. A nice bonus is if you want to start playing with SQLite and Ruby, go through the other <a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqliteruby/">Zetcode SQLite and Ruby</a> tutorial.</p>

              <p>
                To build a Rails application you'll need to be able to save and retrieve data from a database using SQL, send HTML and CSS back to the browser, navigate your computer using the command line, and use git to version control your source code.  Because Rails requires so many skills at once, we don't want the focus of the prework to be Rails, but rather getting introduced to the concepts necessary to build modern web applications.  Hopefully the first time we talk about Rails in the classroom, it won't be the first time you've heard the terms controller or route, but it's also not the goal to master Rails before you get here.  With that in mind, feel free to spend as much time as you'd like exploring Rails through the following tutorials.  However, we're going to cover all of this in depth during the semester so it's probably best to use these turorials as a guide for the component skills you'll need to build web applications.  For example, how much Ruby do I need to know?  Can be answered by building a Rails application and seeing how much Ruby you need to know.

              <p>First, we'd love to thank all the amazing people who created these source materials. Most of it is from CodeSchool and Treehouse, with a bit from Zed Shaw, and some from the people at Skillcrush. Obviously there are a lot more resources out there for learning these topics. This guide is just my current preferences and tries to put them in a linear fashion so skills can build upon each other. Hope it helps someone. Oh and the theme for the site was purchased from <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">WrapBootstrap</a>.</p>
